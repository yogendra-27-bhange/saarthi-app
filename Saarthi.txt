App Name: Saarthi 
‚ÄúYour companion for an accessible world.‚Äù

Meaning:

Saarthi in Hindi means guide or navigator, jaise Mahabharat mein Krishna was Arjun‚Äôs Saarthi. Ye naam emotional bhi hai aur empowering bhi

üõë Problem Statement (for Saarthi App):
‚ÄúPeople with physical disabilities often face serious challenges when visiting public places, such as restaurants without ramps, buildings without elevators, or the absence of accessible washrooms. This lack of accessibility limits their freedom, dignity, and participation in everyday life.‚Äù

üß† Explanation with Examples:
Imagine a wheelchair user wants to visit a caf√© with friends.
They check Google Maps ‚Äî but there's no information about whether the caf√© has a ramp.

They reach the caf√© ‚Äî only to find a flight of stairs and no help available.
Result? They either wait outside or go back home. That‚Äôs not fair.

Similarly, in a hospital or metro station, if there's no working elevator or no accessible washroom, it becomes a daily struggle for them.

üéØ Why we're building Saarthi:
To solve this problem by creating a smart, supportive app that helps people with disabilities:

-- Find accessible places (with ramps, lifts, washrooms)

-- Avoid places that are not suitable

-- Move confidently and independently

‚úÖ Solution (What Saarthi App will do):
Saarthi is a mobile app/ web app that helps differently-abled users find nearby places that are accessible ‚Äî like restaurants with ramps, buildings with elevators, and public washrooms designed for wheelchair use.

üß† Explanation with Examples:
Imagine the same wheelchair user wants to go to a caf√©.

They open the Saarthi app

It shows only those caf√©s nearby that have a proper ramp, wide entry, and accessible washroom

They even see ratings and photos from other users like them

Saarthi even gives directions with wheelchair-friendly routes

This time, they reach comfortably, enter easily, and enjoy their time with friends ‚Äî no frustration, no surprises.
